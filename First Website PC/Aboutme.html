        <h1 class="Title">Intro</h1>
        <p class="content">I was born and raised in Boulder, Colorado as a 4th or 5th generation native (my family is unsure which it is).
          one weird fact about my family is that I actually grew up in the same house as my mother, which she inherited from my grandparents.
          Overall I grew up as a normal kid, living a normal life in Boulder. I've always had a passion for computers that I dabbled with but
          never truly pursued until now.</p>

        <h3 class="Title">Family</h3>
        <p class="content">My family and I are all very close, being that we all live very close to eachother.
        My parents, Jeri and Leonard, were extremely supportive growing up. During highschool I ran
        into difficulties that stemmed from both the education I was recieving and my friend group at the time.
        My parents were super supportive and helped me in the move of switching schools and improving my
        over all mental state. I do have one younger brother named John (we have 9 "J" named in our family)
        and I will say he is one of the best siblings I could ask for. He is 3 years younger than I, and although
        we may have differences, He's one of the best and I couldn't have asked for anyone else. My older cousin has
        been a major motivator for me. He has been in the IT field for as long as I can remember. I always found interest
        in his work and wanted to follow a similar path. Being as he is in the field, he attempted to push me to Galvanize
        several years ago, but strongly warned me that it would be a commitment and that I shouldn't start it until I was ready
        2 years later I finally feel ready to jump head in and give it my all.

        <h3 class="Title">Friends</h3>
        <p class="content">Growing up, I never truly stuck to a single friend group. This was partly because I was a very shy
        kid. Slowly over time I overcame that by just attempting to be the center of attention. But I had always felt
        unneccesary in a way. This is what caused my switch halfway through highschool. In changing my surroundings
        I had learned that I didn't always need to be around others (which I still struggle with to this day). My current
        friends have always been very supportive and they, to me, are my family outside of blood relation.
        One, in particular is David Leonhardt, who pushed me to actually make the leap of faith into Galvanize, helping me
        through the process, and pushing me to do better. Without him and the rest of my close friends, I honestly wouldn't
        be who I am today.</p>

        <h3 class="Title">Hobbies</h3>
        <p class="content">Growing up I could never find something and stick with it per say, I would always be trying something
        new, but never truly mastering anything. I have loved video games growing up and that is one thing that
        never changed, Majorly atleast. As new games come out, I would lose interest in old ones or just not play
        at all. It was perhaps one of the things that got me started on learning computers. Outside of that however,
        I enjoy hiking, exploring new areas and just experiencing new opportunities. Within the past 2 years, I have
        also started to watch anime, and truly appreciate the art style that it brings. Around my senior year of highschool
        I was addicted to cigarrets, which I looked towards vaping as an alternative in order to quit cigarrets. While it did work
        It also turned into a hobby for me, where I was just trying to get the latest model and soon, even worked at a vape shop
        where I learned the actual science behind it and delved further into this new hobby. I worked at that shop for almost 2
        years before the industry side sort of started to kill my passion for it and I took up programming again from my friend
        David, who started his application at Galvanize. He, in essence, rekindled my passion for computers, and now I'm here.</p>

        <h3 class="Title">Conclusion</h3>
        <p class="content">All in all, I have very supportive people in my life, and although it's been a pretty rocky road thus far in life,
        I look forward to the exciting new things I will be learning and making. I feel as though I am an open book, so if anyone
        wants to learn more about me, just ask!</p>
